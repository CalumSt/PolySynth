# PolySynth
A basic polyphonic synthesiser, based on the book by Matthijs Hollemans.

If you want to build it and test it for yourself, all you need to do is clone the repo, then run the following two commands:

```
cmake -S . -B build 
cmake --build build
```

Todo:

- Hook up Filter
- Finish setting up CI Pipeline
- Implement better LFO
- Modulation
- PWM
- Square Wave
- Triangle Wave
- Synth.h unit tests
- UI

Bugs:


Wishlist:

- Ladder Filter
- More oscillator waveforms
